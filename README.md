===================

R Shiny app for viewing item response data from a test I had previously administered.

Here is the code for my first Shiny App! It is the one that I posted previously with a few slight revisions. You can see it at:

In order to make any sense of this I suggest you working through the tutorial (http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) it would be also useful to apply for beta access to the rstudio server which provides free hosting for experimental shiny applications.

To make the code below work you would need two files server.R and ui.R.  Read the tutorial and you will understand their importance.  After reading the tutorial and playing around a little I was able to create the following app.  Hope you can do the same!

Please post as comments links to apps you have developed as well.  Also, feel free to use the data as needed.  It should continue to be updated as more people keep taking the test.
